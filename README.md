# Natural Language Processing 

In this repository you will find what work I did in the NLP 

## NLP Courses
following are few courses which I did and you will find the what I learn in it too. 
1) [Moisac Academy](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/tree/master/MOISAC-NLP) 
2) [Coursera](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/tree/master/MOISAC-NLP/NLPC)


## My Projects & things I explored
so, basically you will find all the cool stuff here 

1) Amazon review classification using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (Will update it later with DL algorithms) [Notebook]('')
2) Implementation of Soundex Algorithm [Notebook](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/blob/master/MOISAC-NLP/SOUNDEX.ipynb)
3) Levenshtein Edit Distance [Notebook](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/blob/master/MOISAC-NLP/Levenshtein%20Edit%20Distance%20.ipynb) 
4) Spell Corrector(Norvig) [Notebook](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/blob/master/MOISAC-NLP/Spell%20Corrector%20.ipynb)
5) [Stemming](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/blob/master/MOISAC-NLP/stemming%20.ipynb) [Lemmitization](https://github.com/rushikeshnaik779/MLE/blob/master/MOISAC-NLP/lemmitization.ipynb)
